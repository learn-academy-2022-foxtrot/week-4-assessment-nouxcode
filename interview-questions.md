# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: Object-oriented programming is a type of programming where data is stored in objects and data can be manipulated, functional programing differs because data can only be manipulated by creating functions and it cannot store data in objects.

Researched answer: Object- oriented programming and functional programming are two of the most commonplace programming systems. Object-oriented programming has been around for longer and is more popular. The key coding elements that OOP uses are objects and methods, functional programming differes because it puts emphasis on functions and variables.

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: Integers and floats are two different types of numerical data. An integer is a number which doesn't have a decimal point, it differs from a float because a float is a which has a decimal point. In code integer is commonly called an int.

Researched answer: Similar to math, integers in programming are considered to be whole numbers which can be negative, positiver, or zero. A float, also known as a floating-point number is a real number. Real numbers are numbers which can be rational or irrational, numbers that contain a fractional component. An example of this would be 74.33. A flaot is a number which contains a decimal point.

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: Implicit returns is when a return isn't explicitly called inside a method. When this happens in Ruby the value of the last executed instructions in the method is returned.

Researched answer: Implicit returns do not have the return keyword. This is because in Ruby implicit returns automatically return the last evaluated expression. Essential, you didn't explicitly state you want to return, however it's still happening because its implicit.

4. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: In Ruby a block is the same as a method however it does not belong to an object. Blocks are anonymous functions which can be passed through methods and they are enclosed with curly braces or in do-end statements.

Researched answer: In Ruby a block is a chunk of code. The code within the block is always enclosed in curly braces and is always invoked from a function of the same name as the block and uses the yield statement.

5. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer: In order to extract a value in a Ruby hash you call the hash followed by a key name using brackets which will extract the value associated with that particular key.

Researched answer: In Ruby, a hash is a collection of key-value pairs separated by commas. Calling the hash followed by a key name within brackets grabs the value associated with that key. Each value is assigned to a key using a hash rocket (formerly known as a codice_1).

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. PostgreSQL: is an open source object relational database system which has over 30 years of active developement.

2. Ruby on Rails: is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby under the MIT License. The framework provides default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages.

3. ORM: stands for object-relational mapping and it is a programming technique that allows for access, and manipulation of objects without having to consider how those objects relate to the source of their data.

4. Active Record: is part of object-relational mapping (ORM), and is a part of code in Ruby that runs between the database and the logic code. When changes are needed to be made to the database you run "migrations" after writing the code which make the actual changes to the database.

5. Migrations: When changes are needed to be made to the database you run "migrations" after writing the code which make the actual changes to the database.
